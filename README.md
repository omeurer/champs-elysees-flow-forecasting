# champs-elysees-flow-forecasting

This machine learning project deals with the forecasting of the flow of people and occupancy rate of the Champs Elys√©es over 7 days. 

The training data is the official data of the city of Paris, for the year 2022.
Weather data is also joined to the dataframe. 

In this notebook, we will see : 
1. Date preprocessing (youhou who doesn't love handling dates ? #TeamUTC+1)
2. EDA for categorical and continuous features
3. Feature engineering on dates, encoding, scaling, etc... aka preprocessing <3 
4. Machine Learning models selection, tuning and even discovering Facebook's Prophet Model
5. Forecasting and plotting for the next week the results.
